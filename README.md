## Events Platform

The overarching goal of this assignment is to build an [eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) like web site.  
The main focus is on developing and deploying backend microservices.

In this part of the assignment we built a first version of the API for accesing the Catalog microservice.

### Part 2

At this point, we added Model View Client (MVC) microservice to enable user interaction with the Catalog microservice.  
We added Identity microservice (based on IdentityServer4 framework) to authorize users and integrated it with the MVC microservice.
